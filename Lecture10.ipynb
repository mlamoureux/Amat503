    "Recall that the 1D wavelet transform takes a vector of length N, multiplies by a special matrix (the wavelet matrix), and then outputs two vectors of size N/2 each. First one is the result of averaging or low-pass filtering (the \"a\" vector) and the other is the result of differencing, or high-pass filtering (the \"d\" vector). Schematically, we can write this in matrix-vector notation as\n",

    "## Discrete convolution, filters, polynomials, Fourier transforms\n",
    "\n",
    "We talked about this briefly in class. \n",
    "\n",
    "I want you to  notice that there are many ways to think about, and to analyse our convolution filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a filter with coeffcients $(h_0, h_1 h_2, \\cdots, h_n)$ you can write down its Fourier transform as $$H(\\omega) = \\sum_k h_k e^{2\\pi i \\omega}$$ or its Z-transform\n",
    "$$H(Z) = \\sum_k h_k Z^k$$ which we notice is a polynomial in (complex) variable $Z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fourier transform is just that polynomial evaluated on points on the unit circle, given by the substitution $$Z = e^{2\\pi i \\omega}.$$ So everything you want to know about the Fourier transform of the filter can be seen from this polynomial. \n",
    "\n",
    "Polynomials, we know can be factored as a product of linear terms $(z-z_k)$, where the points $z_k$ are called the roots of the polynomials. (Or, you can call them  the zeros of the polynomial.) So if you know the zeros of the polynomial, you know pretty much everything there is to know about the polynomial. \n",
    "\n",
    "Don't forget that if the filter coefficients $h_k$ are all real, then the roots of the polynomial have to come in complex conjugate pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyhow, this is a pretty powerful idea. If we want to design a convolution filter, all we have to do is think about zeros of a polynomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, when Daubechies was designing her high pass filter, she knew she had to put a zero at freqency $\\omega = 0$. This means the polynomial had to have a zero (or roots) at $ z= e^{2\\pi i 0}$ which means a root at $z =1$. The lowpass filter has to have a zero at Nyquist frequency, so we need a root at $z = e^{2\\pi i 0.5}$, which is a root at $z=-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We notice the Haar highpass filter has coefficients ($1/2, -1/2)$ which corresponds to the polynomial $(1-z)/2$ which has a root at 1 as expected. The Haar lowpass filter has coefficients $(1/2, 1/2)$ corresponding to polynomial $(1+z)/2$ which has a root at -1. \n",
    "\n",
    "For higher order Daubechies filters, recall we ask for the Fourier transform to have a zero and and zero-derivative at the relevant frequencies. This means the polynomial has to have a double root. For instance, the high pass filter will have a factor like $(z-1)^2$ appearing. \n",

    "## Choice of roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may seem surprising, but different polynomials can have the same filter response -- at least in terms of amplitude. \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, maybe not too surprising. A filter with three coefficients $(0, 2, 1)$ has the same amplitude response as $(2,1)$ since the first has FT \n",
    "$$H_1(\\omega) = 2e^{2\\pi i \\omega} + e^{4\\pi i \\omega} = (2+ e^{2\\pi i \\omega})e^{2\\pi i \\omega}$$\n",
    "while the second has FT \n",
    "$$H_2(\\omega) = 2+ e^{2\\pi i \\omega}.$$\n",
    "These only differ by a factor of $e^{2\\pi i \\omega}$, so when you take absolute values, that factor disappears. The filters do introduce a different delay in the output, but that doesn't show up in the amplitude response. \n",
    "\n",
    "More interestingly, the two filters with coefficients $(2,1)$ and $(1,2)$ also also have the same amplitude response. You should check this yourself: One has FT\n",
    "$$H_1(\\omega) = 2+ e^{2\\pi i \\omega}$$ while the other has\n",
    "$$H_2(\\omega) = 1+ 2e^{2\\pi i \\omega}.$$ Can you do some algebra with complex numbers to convince yourself that \n",
    "$$| H_1(\\omega) | = | H_2(\\omega) |$$\n",
    "for all $\\omega$?\n",
    "\n",
    "These two filters have zeros at different places. The first at $z=-2$, the second at $z = -1/2$. Notice these two zeros are reciprocals of each others.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a general results. In the case of real zeros, flipping a zero with its reciprocal will not change the amplitude response of a (finite) convolutional filter. Its slightly more complicated for complex roots, but when they come in conjugate pairs, it works out nicely. (You have to move both zeros in the pair.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For various reasons, we often choose to take the roots outside the open unit disk in the complex plane. Daubechies hopefully did this -- the assignment for next week asks you to compute the zeros for her filters. We would like to know where they are in the complex plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of these reasons is that engineers like minimum phase delay filters. Such filters cause most of the energy in a signal to pass as quickly as possible. That might be a good thing if you are filtering music or speech -- you don't want it to be delayed for unnecessary processing. "
